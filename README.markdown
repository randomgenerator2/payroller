# Instructions

* Install go: https://golang.org/doc/install
* Run tests: `go test`
* Format code: `go fmt`
* Build code: `go build`
* Run program: `./payroller <path/to/file>`

# TODO

Next step would be to add validators for the data. At the moment payroller relies on that the source of data is valid, for example the data is only for one month and there is only one user with one id etc.

After that I would add more precises info about the payroll/employee, about how much they have worked night shifts etc. 

# Roundup

The project took about 7h to complete.
* 1,5h getting familiar with go lang (last time I used go was before it was released).
* 0,5h Planning how I want to do this and documenting.
* 2,5h developing tests and testing.
* 2,5h developing actual software.

I wanted to do the project with go, because it was so long since the last time I had an opportunity to use it for something "meaningful".
